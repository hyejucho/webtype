            <img src="cat.jpg" alt="cat">
        
                        <p>1. Very few people understand you.</p>
                        <p>2. In fact, they may get aggressive at the mention of your repulsion. Which doesn’t make any sense because have you smelt those things?</p>
                        <p>3. You shudder at the thought of those slimy sonsabitches on your eyes for ‘relaxation’.</p>
                        <p>4. You can’t remember the last time you bought a ready-made salad. They’re the cucumber’s natural habitat and you avoid them like the plague.</p>
                        <p>5. Same goes for ready-made sandwiches and wraps. It’s a scary world out there</p>
                        <p>6. The thought of cucumber in water or as a way to ‘enhance’ a beverage makes you gag.</p>
                        <p>7. You’ve wept over the ruining of a perfectly good meal by cucumber poisoning.</p>
                        <p>8. "No, I can’t just eat around it. Everything is tainted.”</p>
                        <p>9. The smell (or touch) alone has you grumpy for hours.</p>
                        <p>10. As far as you’re concerned, cockroaches are brothers in arms as they’re also repulsed by that insidious green dong. Ain’t no shame. Every man (and roach) is needed in the resistance. </p>
                        <p>11. You’ve lost your cool when it’s been included in a meal despite not being on the menu #sorrynotsorry.</p>
                        <p>12. You’ve shown everyone those videos of cuke’s scaring cats to legitimise your struggle.</p>
                        <p>13. You’ve grabbed what you thought was zucchini at the shops only to come home, realise your folly and fly into a rage.</p>
                        <p>14. You’ve referred to it as the Catch Me If You Can of vegetables i.e. it’s really a fruit and shouldn’t be trusted.</p>
                        <p>15. You’ve faked being allergic just to avoid it and the conversation that must accompany, “seriously, no cucumber.”</p>
                        <p>16. Urban Dictionary defines it as “A female sexual toy cleverly disguised as a vegetable” and while you’re down with being open and free with one’s sexual self…. you’d rather eat your own hair than go down that road.</p>
                        <p>17. Surprisingly, you’re okay with pickles. </p>
                        <p>18. “Just try it” is met with derision so sharp it could slice a damn cucumber.</p>
                        <p>19. If stranded on a desert island with only cucumber to eat… you’d gladly starve.</p>
                        <p>20. Gazpacho sucks.</p>
